Project Title: JNTUA GPA Calculator

Overview: The JNTUA GPA Calculator is a web-based application designed for students of JNTUA College of Engineering, Pulivendula, to conveniently calculate their Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). The application provides a user-friendly interface that allows students to input their grades and credits, facilitating quick and accurate GPA calculations.

Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The calculator is designed with an intuitive layout, making it easy for students to navigate and use. The responsive design ensures compatibility across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
SGPA Calculator:
Allows users to select the number of subjects for the semester.
Users can input their grade points and corresponding credit hours for each subject.
The calculator computes the SGPA using the formula:
𝑆𝐺𝑃𝐴=∑(Credit Points × Grade Points)/∑(Total Credits)
SGPA= ∑(Total Credits)/∑(Credit Points×Grade Points)
Results are displayed in a pop-up modal for immediate feedback.
CGPA Calculator:
Users can select the number of semesters they wish to include in their CGPA calculation.
Inputs for SGPA and total credits for each semester are provided.
The CGPA is calculated using the formula:
𝐶𝐺𝑃𝐴 = ∑(Total Credits in Semester × SGPA of Semester)/∑(Total Credits in Semester)
CGPA= ∑(Total Credits in Semester)/∑(Total Credits in Semester×SGPA of Semester) 
Results are also shown in a pop-up modal for convenience.
Modal Pop-Ups: The use of modal pop-ups enhances the user experience by providing results without navigating away from the current page.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that users have a seamless experience on different screen sizes and devices.
Visual Aesthetics: The calculator features an appealing design with a gradient background, rounded input boxes, and stylish buttons, creating an engaging user experience.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the web pages and forms.
CSS: For styling the application, ensuring a visually appealing interface.
JavaScript: For implementing the functionality of the calculators, including dynamic field generation and calculations.
Target Audience: This GPA calculator is primarily targeted at engineering students at JNTUA College of Engineering, Pulivendula. It is intended to help students keep track of their academic performance and assist in planning their courses based on their GPA.

Future Enhancements:

Integration of user accounts to save GPA history.
Option to export or download GPA reports.
Additional features like grade conversion and academic planning tools.
